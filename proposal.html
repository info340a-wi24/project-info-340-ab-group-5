            Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").

        <h2>
            Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
        </h2>
        <p>
            An information technology problem associated with fitness tracker apps is incomplete data entry. 
            Users may misreport the quantity of food consumed, and variations in portion sizes compared to the app's default settings can lead to issues of accuracy and reliability. 
            This challenge compromises the effectiveness of the fitness tracking experience.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
        </h2>
        <p>
            An approach that has been previously implemented involves talking to health providers. 
            However, a drawback is that these apps often designate this feature as a premium option, requiring users to pay for access. 
            In our pursuit of making our app more economical, our strategy is to incorporate reminders. 
            This ensures that users consistently remember to log their dietary intake.
