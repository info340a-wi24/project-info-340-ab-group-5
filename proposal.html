            Problem/Data Domain
        </h2>

        <!--
        <h2>
            Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            Keeping track of daily caloric and macronutrient intake can be a hassle. Additionally, tracking an exercise routine along with the number of reps and sets can become too much for one to remember. Our solution to this is a Health and Fitness Tracker where users will be able to set and track their nutritional goals along with their exercise routine.
        </p>

        <!--
        <h2>
            Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            An information technology problem associated with fitness tracker apps is incomplete data entry. 
            Users may misreport the quantity of food consumed, and variations in portion sizes compared to the app's default settings can lead to issues of accuracy and reliability. 
            This challenge compromises the effectiveness of the fitness tracking experience.
        </p>

        <!--
        <h2>
            Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            An approach that has been previously implemented involves talking to health providers. 
            However, a drawback is that these apps often designate this feature as a premium option, requiring users to pay for access. 
            In our pursuit of making our app more economical, our strategy is to incorporate reminders. 
            This ensures that users consistently remember to log their dietary intake.

            App Description
        </h2>

        <!--
        <h2>
            Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            The users of this application would be the general populace, specifically those intent on recording their workouts and food intake. This application can also be used by those trying to lose weight or better their mental health through exercise and dieting. This application does not really have any impact on minority groups as everyone would be able to record their food intake and exercise. A possible impact this app might have is on those who cannot complete certain workouts possibly due to a disability or those who cannot eat certain foods. However, this application can be adapted to include vegan or vegetarian options for food intake, as well as wheelchair as a workout option to include those who are disabled.

            What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide?
        </h2>
        -->
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first interactive feature that we are expecting to provide is a place to input ones workout. This feature will have a place to input the amount of time for the workout, the amount of distance they have ran, hiked, biked, etc., and other options. Additionally, the user will be able their workouts over time to measure their improvements and see how far they have come.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another interactive feature would be the ability to enter what a user eats in a day, from breakfast to lunch to dinner. The user can enter each food item individually or enter a food option off of a saved list (from being entered previously). The stats (i.e. fats, sugars, carbs, etc.) will be broken down for each food item, so the user can monitor their sugars, fats, carbs, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The final "half" interactive feature would be allowing a user to set a recommended daily calorie intake. Any food item inputted will increase the calorie amount per day, and the calories burned from any workout inputted would be subtracted from calorie amount per day.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!--
        <h2>
            What kind of information will the users be viewing?
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            There will be a variety of information that the users will be viewing, ranging from their caloric intake from food broken down into fats, sugars, etc. to the amount of time and/or distance they worked out. The main pipeline of information would be the user inputting the distance or time they worked out, or the multiple items of food they have eaten for a meal.
        </p>

        <!--
        <h2>
            How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
        </h2>
        -->

        <p>
            Using this app will help to solve our chosen problem in that it makes tracking one's food intake and workout less of a hassle. With reminders being implemented to remind the user to input their food and workouts, both the user's mental and physical well-being will greatly increase. Finally, the user will not have to worry about how many calories each item of food is or about how many grams of sugar they have eaten.
